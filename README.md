# Oppam (ഒപ്പം) - SDG 3 Health Companion

**Oppam** (meaning "Together") is a prototype for a collaborative health monitoring system designed to support low-income urban patients with chronic diseases (like diabetes and hypertension) and community health workers (ASHA) in Kerala.

This project was developed as part of the **Agile Development & Case Tool Lab** assignment to address **SDG Goal 3: Good Health & Well-being**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Low-income urban patients often struggle with medication adherence and missing follow-up clinic visits. **Oppam** provides a digital bridge between patients, ASHA workers, and Health Inspectors to ensure 100% compliance and timely medical intervention.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Patient Dashboard**: Daily medication logging, automated reminders, health vitals tracking (BP/Sugar), and appointment management.
- **ASHA Worker Portal**: Real-time monitoring of patient adherence in assigned wards and a "High-Risk" priority list for home visits.
- **Health Inspector Analytics**: Ward-wise health statistics and adherence trends to allocate resources effectively.
- **Localized Focus**: Designed with the Kerala healthcare ecosystem (ASHA/HI roles) in mind.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- **Design Methodology**: Agile Development (User Stories, Sprint Planning)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html`: The gateway page to select between Patient and Health Worker portals.
- `patient_dash.html`: High-fidelity dashboard for chronic disease patients.
- `health_worker_dash.html`: Administrative dashboard for ASHA workers and Health Inspectors.
